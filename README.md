HEAPS

A Heap is a complete binary Tree Structure that satisfies the heap property in that the largest or smallest element is the root node of the tree and the rest are descendants

PROPERTIES OF HEAPS

Structural where the heap is arranged in a complete binary tree except maybe for the last heap Heaps are ordered. They can either be a maximum or minimum heap Heaps have operations for insertion, deletion and heapify Heaps are implemented in arrays

ADVANTAGES OF HEAPS

Efficient priority queue where the highest priority element is always at the top Guaranteed access to the maximum or minimum value Space efficiency

DISADVANTAGES OF HEAPS

Time complexity; It is not ideal for organizations that require faster algorithms Lack of flexibility as heaps are designed to store elements in a specified order Limited access to an element that requires traversing the whole tree which in turn has a time complexity
